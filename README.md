## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass for styles
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project has been a great challenge for me to practice in using useRef() hook to implement keybaord navigation. Definitely will continue on that in the next applications. Also touched slightly ARIA topic but still need to learn more on that.

Also used useImage() hook (found it on the Internet but can't recall the author or site) to load images to the page dynamically without using PUBLIC folder.

### Continued development

As stated above will further look into building accessible applications and expand on React hooks.
